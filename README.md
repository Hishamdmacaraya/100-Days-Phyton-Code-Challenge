# 100 Days of Phyton Code Challenge
Python coding projects as part of #100DaysOfCode challenge

## What Is The #100DaysOfCode Challenge?
100 Days Of Code is a social media project, primarily on Twitter, that anyone can participate in via the #100DaysOfCode hashtag. Developer Alex Kallaway started it in 2016 based on the idea that consistency is the path to mastery.

## Day 1: Username and Password Generator
Made a simple username and password generator. The username generates a unique combination of first name, last name, and last 4 digits of social security number. The password generates a unique combination of name, date of birth, and a random 4-digit string. 

## Restaurant Bill Calculator 
For day 2 of my #100DaysOfCode challenge, I made a simple restaurant bill calculator that calculates total payment due, total tax due, and splits the bill for multiple payors.
